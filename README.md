This is the beginning of my software engineering journey, I look forward to a flabbergasting experience!

This repo covers in-depth knowledge about C programming, I can tell you C is fun!
It contains the basics of C programming from hello world, arguments, malloc, preprocessors, function pointer, variables, if else and loops, pointer and pointer to pointer to pointers lol! recursion, static libraries, linked list, singly list, bit manipulation, i/o files manipulations, doubly linked list, simple shell, and a whole lot more I am yet to discover. 
let me digress a bit,
it has been lots of struggling, googling, reading, and all the ings, you can think of, but always has been fun as I discover more and more, they say curiosity killed the cat, haha! I am not a cat!!!
